# About

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu/)
at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). My research interests span 
distributed systems, databases, networking, and algorithms.

**I am looking for highly motivated graduate students. Please send me an email if you are interested.**
