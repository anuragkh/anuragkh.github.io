# About

I'm a Graduate Student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), 
pursuing my PhD at the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu) and advised by 
[Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I also work closely 
with [Rachit Agarwal](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/index.html), my (unofficial)
co-advisor. I completed my bachelor's degree (B. Tech. in Computer Science and 
Engineering) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in).
