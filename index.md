# About

**I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/).**
**I will join [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in January '20**

**I am looking for highly motivated graduate students. Please send me an email if you are interested.**

I received my PhD from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), 
at the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu), where I was advised by 
[Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and worked closely with
[Rachit Agarwal](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/index.html). I completed my
bachelor's degree (B. Tech. in Computer Science and 
Engineering) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in).
