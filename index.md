# About

**I am currently a postdoctoral associate at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/).**
**I will join [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in January '20**

**I am looking for highly motivated graduate students. Please send me an email if you are interested.**

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu/)
at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). My research interests span 
distributed systems, databases, networking, and algorithms.

Prior to starting at Yale, I did a short post-doc at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/)
where I worked with [Tom Ristenpart](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/) and
[Rachit Agarwal](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ragarwal/index.html).
I received my PhD from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), 
at the [RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu), where I was advised by 
[Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/). I completed my
bachelor's degree (B. Tech. in Computer Science and 
Engineering) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in).
