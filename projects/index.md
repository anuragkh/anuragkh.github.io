		<h2>Internships and Research Experience</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Attacking Data Center Networks (April 2012 - July 2012)</h4>
            <div>at <span class="name"><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research, Redmond</a></span></div>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>This project involved understanding problems in Data Center Networks and analyzing them from an adversarial perspective. We looked at how a malicious tenant could exploit certain problems in Data Center Networks to deny service to certain other tenants, or get an unfair share of the network resources.</li>
			</ul>

			<em>Mentors: Seny Kamara and Navendu Jain, XCG, Microsoft Research, Redmond </em>
          </li>

			<h4>Systems Programming Intern (May 2011 - July 2011)</h4>
            <div>at <span><a href="http://www.nucleodyne.com/" target="_blank">Nucleodyne Systems</a></span></div>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>As a part of the training, I looked at driver development for the HP-UX Kernel and analysis of the Linux SCSI Subsystem using the System Tap tool. A significant part of our work also involved understanding and testing the SCSI protocol and its command set. We also worked towards the automation of SCSI command set testing with a Virtual Tape Library. </li>

			<h4>Routing in DTNs with Directional Antennas (Winter 2010)</h4>
            <div>at <span><a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Kharagpur</a></span></div>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>This project involved the study of the decrement of routing time in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) with directional antennas as opposed to those with omnidirectional antennas. We attempted to compare our model to the small world model and understand how the collapse in the graph diameter contributed to better performance in case of directional antennas.</li>

				<div>at <span><a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Kharagpur</a></span></div>
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Developed a Versioning File System built on top of FUSE (File System in User Space) for UNIX environment for the Inter-Hall OpenSoft Competition.</li>
